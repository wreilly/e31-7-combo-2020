Give this a go: << Working!
"@Thom - you can add a regular public init() method on your service, import the service and call it from your AppComponent's ngOnInit() â€“ Joe Hanink Oct 28 '19 "

    /* Q. Hmm, should BOTH call this ?? Header. Sidenav. hmm.

    For the non, guess I'll leave the call (above) in. hmm.

       A.1. Well, looks like we CAN call it ... but...
       That is, not breaking things (from what I can tell).
       Unsure if it is doing a lot of unnecessary redundant
       calling of the reducer .select() etc. etc.
       o well.

       A.2. But do note that it appears we can
       get away with NOT calling it from Sidenav!

       Why is that? I dunno, may be because the Header
       Component is ALWAYS instantiated, and does its own
       call for this init() in Service biz,
       and by the time we see the (user-requested-via-click)
       Sidenav instantiated, the Service already
       has gotten this Observable hooked up to the Store,
       re: show or hide labels. Doesn't need to be called
       by the just-showed-up Sidenav to have the
       Service (re)-perform this init() biz.
       Don't you think?
