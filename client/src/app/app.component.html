        APP CdkStrollable dataWeGot
        Scroll biz scrollData.getElementRef()  MAT-SIDENAV-CONTENT

    2. WITHOUT IT = Only then will this work:
    - "hide/show", "floating/positioned" "scroll-to-top" component (uurrgghh)
    - And, window/document/body *do* "hear" scroll events...

Also: over in scroll-top.component.ts:
    *****************************************************
    With <mat-sidenav-container fullscreen>, window/document/body "hear" nothing.
    But with 'fullscreen' removed, they *do* hear scroll events. (sheesh)

    re: fullscreen, viz. scroll
    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46996191/how-to-detect-scroll-events-in-mat-sidenav-container

CSS:
   fullscreen gets you:
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  right: 0;
  bottom: 0;
  position: absolute;

<!--  Hmm, seem to be learning
this 'mat-app-background' (below) is NOT needed.
I guess that is the story when we have the
'dark-theme' biz up above ... ?
Appears that w. Material Design
you automatically either get:
background-color: '#fafafa' (light)
background-color: '#303030' (dark)

    The "top" concept, in Angular Material Design, comes to here: mat-sidenav-content. (Not 'body' nor 'html'). cheers.

<!-- Hmm, above "works" sort of.
Angular automagically does insert <mat-sidenav-content> above/around my <div>. OK.
With 'fullscreen'
- Scroll biz = Yes (nice). (cdkScrollable on <mat-sidenav-content> and on nested <div>)
- But "sticky footer" gets lost (wtf).
- Also footer's "back to top" click fails
Without 'fullscreen'
- Scroll biz = Yes (nice). (cdkScrollable on <mat-sidenav-content> and on nested <div>)
- But "sticky footer" gets lost (wtf).
- Also footer's "back to top" click fails
- And/but, our buddy "scroll-top.component" does hide/show, correctly! (cwazy)

      Ok.
      But I may not want it to appear where ArticleListComponent does, since
      it will now have its own Scroll down/up, with the new Paginator.
      Hmm.
      Q. To achieve that new result, where do I continue to place this ScrollComponent?
      A. Hmm, I guess maybe on AddArticleComponent, maybe ArticlesComponent?
      Looks like I'll have to control for it appearing, or not,
      under ArticlesComponent <router-outlet>, the way I do for that
      "Recent Article" - seen in some, not all of the routes. O la.

    Update ????
    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46996191/how-to-detect-scroll-events-in-mat-sidenav-container
    Will try the DIV instead, for moment

**************************
UPDATE TWO
**************************
No. Back to NOT just DIV.
Q. Y?
A. We lost (damned) sticky footer with just DIV. Putting back <mat-sidenav-content> made sticky footer work again.
(Note that yes of course this was with FULLSCREEN set to ON/STUN.)
**************************

    Conclusion: going to stick with putting in <mat-sidenav-content> myself.
    I believe that is helping me wherever I can access it via
    document.querySelector('mat-sidenav-content').scrollTop

    Findings such as they/it are:
    Hmm, re: experiment, not seeing definitive difference(s)
    using <div> in place of <mat-sidenav-content>
    This page had couple opinions on that. Ho hum.
